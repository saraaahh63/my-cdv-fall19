    <p>During the past few years, diversity and representation in media has come to the forefront of cultural conversation. However, much of this conversation has been centered around what we see on the screen and not who has a hand in shaping the art. Representation on the screen is a wonderful thing, but to produce truly relevant and moving cinema, we need filmmakers that relate to and understand the experiences of the diverse characters we see represented.<br><br>This website maps out the directors of every Hollywood movie released between the years 2009 and 2013 by gender and ethnicity, so we can take stock of where we were in the entertainment industry just a few years ago. This data has been scraped off of Wikipedia.</p>
