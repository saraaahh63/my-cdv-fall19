    <p>During the past few years, diversity of representation has come to the forefront of cultural conversation. We as a society are asking for diverse stories and diverse characters, and for the most part we are being heard. However, much of this conversation has been centered around what we seen on the screen and not who has a hand in shaping it. Representation on the screen is a wonderful thing, but to produce truly relevant and touching film, we need filmmakers that relate to and understand the experiences of the diverse characters we are just beginning to meet.<br><br>This website maps out the directors of every Hollywood movie released between the years 2009 and 2013 by gender and ethnicity, so we can take stock of where we were in the entertainment inductry just a few years ago. This data has been scraped off of Wikipedia.</p>
