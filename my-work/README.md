## my work

This folder contains all of the in-class exercises, homework, and projects I completed for Critical Data & Visualization.

This class was my first introduction to D3.js and I fell absolutely in love!

If you're interested please take a look at my final project: [The Hollywood Diversity Report](https://github.com/saraaahh63/my-cdv-fall19/tree/master/my-work/Final%20Project). I taught myself how to scrape in order to compile my own dataset. It was definitely a labor of love and it sparked continued interest in Python, data visualization, and web scraping.
