#Why does Bowker say "'Raw data is both an oxymoron and a bad idea'" ? (pp. 663)

Data is never raw, it is always "cooked" through the ways in which it is collected. Raw data is a bad idea because meaning is lost when you decontextualize collected information. Claiming data as raw ignores the subectivity and limitations of big data.

#What could be meant by the quote "'accounting tools [...] do not simply aid the measurement of economic activity, they shape the reality they measure'"? Try draw parallels to the CompStat system from the Reply All Podcast.

The tools used in the collection or creation of objects and systems often leave unintended marks. For example, the CompStat system which was intended to aid in police work eventually changed the system of policing. With so much emphasis on crime rates, police officers diverted their attention from stopping crimes to preemptively surveying areas with high crime rates.

#In which way is Twitter data limited?

Twitter data is limited for many reasons. Twitter users are not representative of a global whole; they are simply a subset. The APIs used to access twitter data only have access to a small percentage of public tweets. There is also not much information available on how or why the API pulls these tweets. Access to twitter data is limited to institutions who have enough capital to purchase access.

#If you don't need to login to obtain certain data, then it is public and free to use. Or isn't it? Please share your opinion.

I don't have a very strong opinion on this yet. I don't think data that is public is necessarily free for public use, but I also think that the burden of privacy falls somewhat on the user. The internet in my mind is a wealth of knowledge that should be accessible to all - if you want to create a private space for yourself, then enable the privacy tools made available on whatever platform you are using. Otherwise, you should understand that people are going to do what they will with what you say. I think it's easy to say I'm okay with this reasoning when I think of it from a research perspective, but if we're talking about advertisers or how the platform handles your data; the monetization of personal data and their general lack of transparency do concern me. I understand that these platforms would not be free if they had no way of making money off me, so I guess it's a small price to pay for the infrastructure they provide, but I'm not sure if I believe this.
