### New Dark Age: Cloud

Note: I picked the first quote and wrote my response to it as I was reading and not after I had read the whole chapter. In hindsight, I probably should have read the whole thing first.

**Three Quotes:**

> "In all of these cases, surveilance reveals itself as a wholly retroactive enterprise, incapable of acting in the present and entirely subservient to the established and utterly compromised interests of power. What was missing in Rwanda and Srebrenica was not evidence of an atrocity, but the willingness to act upon it." (243)

I think this is a fair assessment in terms of surveilance and governmental inaction, but to Schmidt's credit, he cites the internet age and smartphones as a possible deterrent to the Rwandan Genocide, not the government's knowledge of the genocide. This distinction is important because governments or (more appropriately) politicians are rarely motivated by anything that does not immediately benefit them, so the public outcry that would have been generated around the issue as a result of internet/smartphones would have been their motivator. I looked up [newspaper headlines](https://www.newspapers.com/topics/world-history/rwandan-genocide/) from 1994 out of curiosity and most media at the time either mischaracterized the Rwandan Genocide as "tribal war" or spontaneous violence. If the media had been more accurate, less racist and had greater access to images of the genocide, the public would not have been as indiferrent. The internet is key in shifting news and media and the presentation of news is key in shifting public opinion. This isn't to say that had there been enough protesting, the US would have intervened. They would have to consider the backlash and costs that come from sending troops, but at least more of that discussion would have entered the public sphere where voters could act as a check and balance. 

This is in terms of how the internet could have motivated foreign intervention. Domestically, it could have promoted hate speech and violence like it did in Kenya. But then again, they were already using radio broadcasts to do the same thing. No matter what kind of technology is around, there will be attempts at radicalizing people and escalating violence though tech, but with internet/smartphones there's a better chance of involving the outside world and cutting through that radicalization. On the other hand, there's also the chance that third parties will be radicalized themselves (i.e.; westerners running off to join ISIS), but that stems from systemic problems in society and shouldn't be blamed on the internet and smartphones. Cellphones can create closed communities that allow violence to breed, but so can word of mouth.

In any case, everything is at the mercy of established powers - that's just the nature of how our society is structured, but public knowledge and public voices can sometimes counteract this system.

>"Our thirst for data, like our thirst for oil, is historically imperialist and colonialist, and tightly tied to capitalist networks of exploitation." (246)

This is true, and can be said about everything most countries do because that's what most countries are built on. I don't really think the problem is with data - it's with our institutions. Data is just the newest resource to exploit. I think the point I made earlier is relevant here too. public knowledge and public voices can counteract this exploitation (and data fascism). All we need is data literacy.

>"We've built modern civilization on the dialectic that more information leads to better decisions, but our engineering has caught up with our philosophy." (250)

Information overload makes it harder for us to act and desensitizes us to things that happen in the world. On a personal scale, I do think that more information leads to better decisions.
